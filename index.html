                    PROTONIFY COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU ONLY WHEN YOU VOLUNTARILY
                    PROVIDE IT. Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your
                    personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances,
                    consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use
                    (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously
                    identified).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied,
                    will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the
                    reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.

                <p>
                    You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual
                    restrictions and reasonable notice. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any
                    time, please contact our privacy department at privacy@protonify.com. If you
                    refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you or continue
                    to provide you with certain services or information that may be of value to you.

                    We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you
                    to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that
                    required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which
                    the information is being provided.

                <p>
                    We may also use (but will not disclose) your personal information to promote and
                    market additional goods, services and special offers from us, our affiliates and

                <p>How We Protect Your Personal Information</p>
                <p>
                    Protonify makes all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that personal
                    information collected from you is protected against loss and unauthorized
                    access. This protection applies in relation to information stored in both
                    electronic and hard-copy form. Access to your personal information is restricted
                    to selected employees or representatives. In addition, Protonify employs robust
                    information security techniques to protect personal information against loss and
                    unauthorized access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Protonify educates all its employees on the importance of privacy. It is
                    Protonify's policy to give access to personal information only to those
                    employees who require it to carry out the responsibilities of their jobs or to
                    other such third parties with similar designated responsibilities and who are

                    system and destroyed in a manner that ensures your security.
